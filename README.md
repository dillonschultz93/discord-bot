# discord-bot

A Discord bot for a Discord server I own.

## Commands

### !hello | !hi

The bot will greet the user

### !uptime | !ut

The bot will output how long it has been booted up for

### !roll [d(n)]

The bot will output a random number based on the dice level. Valid dice levels are 2-20.
